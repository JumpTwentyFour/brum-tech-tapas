            <p>I research the micro side of the creative industries, exploring how freelancers and small businesses connect with each other and the place they are in.</p>

            <p>The idea of ‘place’ is how I bring together the things I’ve done for work and play over
              the last ten years, whether that’s research, evaluation, or mountain leadership. The creative sector
              is the focus of my work because it’s important to me personally, and it generates so much more than
              the economic value that policy support is framed around. Why are we encouraged to compete and make money,
              rather than collaborate and make art?</p>

            <p>I’m interested in the relationships between individuals and place, between values and work, and the networks
              and collaborations that make creative things happen. My PhD brought all of that together under the umbrella of
              the ‘creative ecosystem’ in the West Midlands. The thesis won an economic geography research award, which at
              least means that someone read it.</p>

            <p>I’m looking forward to being part of this line up, and offering some food for thought on what a creative ecosystem means in practice.</p>
